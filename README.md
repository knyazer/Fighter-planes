# Fighter planes

It is one of my first projects and the very first project on github. The game was made to participate in js13kgames. However, the game is pretty decent, eventhough it works only on PC and you need to decrease a volume to play, because explosion sound very loud. And it also takes less than 13kb in archived version, which you can tell from the name of the competition
